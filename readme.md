### A game for nand2tetris part 2, project 9.

---

Plugging away at nand2tetris, an excellent course/book by Profs. Nissan and Shocken.

Project 9 requires you to write something in JACK, a sort of Java-like language, to understand it well enough to build a compiler. Here's my submission. I've chosen Snake as it's about the simplest game I know.

Code for linear congruential psuedo-random generator from *https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse365/index.php* If you need one of these, there's a few implementations to help learners, including one on the Coursera discussion page.

**Obviously, respect the honor code and don't turn this (or any other stuff on github) in as your own work.** 

Besides, you'll need to understand JACK for the next project :)
