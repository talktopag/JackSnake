# Snek
### A game for nand2tetris part 2, project 9.

---

Plugging away at nand2tetris, an excellent course/book by Profs. Nissan and Shocken.

Project 9 requires you to write something nice in JACK, a sort of Java-like language. Here's my work in progress. I've never written a game or programmed anything in Java before, so I've chosen snake as it's about the simplest game I know.

Code for linear congruential psuedo-random generator from *https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse365/index.php*

**Obviously, respect the honor code and don't turn this (or any other stuff on github) in as your own work.**
